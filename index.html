                3/22: Brendan Kolb &mdash; 'Kant's Propensity to Evil'
            </li>

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Kant claims that all human virtue is attained only in striving against evil within oneself. When he articulates and defends this doctrine in his <i>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</i>, it becomes clear that central to it is the notion of a "propensity to evil" (Hang zum Böse). Kant claims that this propensity is universal to humanity, that it is imputable to us as a result of our free choice, that it is itself evil, that it is inextirpable by our own powers, and that we must also be able to somehow overcome it without extirpating it. How can all of these things be true? I'll look at the effort of Seiriol Morgan to explain the propensity and hold onto most of these claims, all except the claim that the propensity is itself evil; then I'll explain where I think Morgan goes wrong and offer my own explanation of the propensity. It's controversial and still under construction, so I'll appreciate your critiques.

                    My present reading is that while the propensity to evil is the result of a free choice, its presence in us can be inferred, on Kantian premises, from the fact that we are rational beings existing in time. What's uncontroversial in the reading is that as rational beings in time and space, all our actions are subject both to an explanation in terms of natural causes, and an explanation in terms of freedom. My controversial claim is that, because the naturally determined explanations of our actions can simply make no room for the unconditional universal moral law, it can be inferred that we will freely choose to follow something other than the law, namely our self-love—even when we act in conformity with the law. So the moral law is, in a very real sense, larger than life, not cut to the fit of our spatiotemporal lives. So I will differ from Morgan and say that the claim Kant can't maintain, or at least is fudging, about the propensity is that we can overcome it without extirpating it.

                11/16: Aarthy Vaidyanathan &mdash; 'The Rationality of Vengeful Anger'

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Sometimes our experience of anger includes a wish for payback. And anger can seem problematic to the extent that it includes this wish. Martha Nussbaum has suggested, for instance, that we should try to change ourselves to whatever degree possible to lessen our tendency to anger and when we do get angry learn to laugh it off. Nussbaum grants that an angry person who wants to ameliorate the injury she (or another) is suffering has a morally laudable aim but argues that she is irrational in thinking she can bring it about through payback — through the suffering of the person who injured her. The idea that another person's suffering could make the victim's injury any better does seem irrational, reminiscent of voodoo dolls and ritual killings. Nussbaum has drawn attention to something that is a serious concern. My goal in this talk is to defend the rationality of this kind of anger by articulating a way of making sense of its core idea.

                11/9: Pietro Cibinel &mdash; 'Self-Ascriptions of Bias'

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Suppose some agent asserts or believes that when it comes to a certain subject matter, their opinions are biased in a certain direction. Perhaps, in a conversation about politics, a friend shares her views but then follows up, with no false modesty: "...but take that with a grain of salt, I'm certainly biased". Your friend seems reasonable in admitting that. But how is this different from cases of epistemic akrasia, in which one holds certain opinions, but also believes that those opinions are epistemically flawed? In this talk, I argue that some bias self-ascriptions are rational and others irrational. This accommodates two facts: that admitting that one is biased sounds fine in many contexts, and that yet something seems odd about thinking of one's own opinions that they're flawed, in being tainted by bias.
