                11/16: Aarthy Vaidyanathan &mdash; 'The Rationality of Vengeful Anger'

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Sometimes our experience of anger includes a wish for payback. And anger can seem problematic to the extent that it includes this wish. Martha Nussbaum has suggested, for instance, that we should try to change ourselves to whatever degree possible to lessen our tendency to anger and when we do get angry learn to laugh it off. Nussbaum grants that an angry person who wants to ameliorate the injury she (or another) is suffering has a morally laudable aim but argues that she is irrational in thinking she can bring it about through payback — through the suffering of the person who injured her. The idea that another person's suffering could make the victim's injury any better does seem irrational, reminiscent of voodoo dolls and ritual killings. Nussbaum has drawn attention to something that is a serious concern. My goal in this talk is to defend the rationality of this kind of anger by articulating a way of making sense of its core idea.

                11/9: Pietro Cibinel &mdash; 'Self-Ascriptions of Bias'

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Suppose some agent asserts or believes that when it comes to a certain subject matter, their opinions are biased in a certain direction. Perhaps, in a conversation about politics, a friend shares her views but then follows up, with no false modesty: "...but take that with a grain of salt, I’m certainly biased". Your friend seems reasonable in admitting that. But how is this different from cases of epistemic akrasia, in which one holds certain opinions, but also believes that those opinions are epistemically flawed? In this talk, I argue that some bias self-ascriptions are rational and others irrational. This accommodates two facts: that admitting that one is biased sounds fine in many contexts, and that yet something seems odd about thinking of one's own opinions that they're flawed, in being tainted by bias.
