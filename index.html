            Welcome! Princeton PhilSoc provides a venue for <a href='https://www.princeton.edu/' target='_blank'>Princeton</a> graduate students in the <a href='https://philosophy.princeton.edu/' target='_blank'>philosophy department</a> to present their work.

                11/9: Pietro Cibinel &mdash; 'Self-Ascriptions of Bias'

                <p class='abstract'>
                    Abstract: Suppose some agent asserts or believes that when it comes to a certain subject matter, their opinions are biased in a certain direction. Perhaps, in a conversation about politics, a friend shares her views but then follows up, with no false modesty: "...but take that with a grain of salt, Iâ€™m certainly biased". Your friend seems reasonable in admitting that. But how is this different from cases of epistemic akrasia, in which one holds certain opinions, but also believes that those opinions are epistemically flawed? In this talk, I argue that some bias self-ascriptions are rational and others irrational. This accommodates two facts: that admitting that one is biased sounds fine in many contexts, and that yet something seems odd about thinking of one's own opinions that they're flawed, in being tainted by bias.
